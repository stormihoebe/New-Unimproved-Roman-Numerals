#### By _Alex Lee & Stormi Hoebelheinrich_

## Description

This is an application that takes in a sentence and returns a pig latin translation of that sentence.
Specs:
The application should do noting to non-alphabetical characters
The application should add "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel
the application should move consonants at the beginning of the word to the end of the word and then add "ay"
to the end
The application should move "qu" together when they appear at the beginning of a word
The application should return the full sentence completely translated into pig latin
## Setup/Installation Requirements
Open the terminal and preform the following:
```
cd /desiredLocation
```
```
git clone https://github.com/doomcatlee/piglatin
```
```
cd pigLatin
```
```

```

## Known Bugs

The program does not properly move q and u together to the end of the sentence. Punctuation was not considered, and sometimes appears in the middle of a word, before the "ay" ending.
